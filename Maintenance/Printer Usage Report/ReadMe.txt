Printer Usage Report
Version 2, November 2018, James Pearman

1) Purpose
This script generates a report on printer usage from a print server on printers using a particular IP range.The script generates a report from the operational printer event logs, saves them as a .csv and emails that report to the address you enter it to go to.

2) What you Need!
Make sure you have operation print event logging enabled and the log file is big enough for your needs.

3) Changes from V1
The following has been added:
        a) Ability to email reports
        b) Use of IP range as opposed to printer name
        c) Interactive date input for the start and end of the report instead of editing the script.
